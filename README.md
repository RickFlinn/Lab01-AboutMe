# Lab01-AboutMe


This is a simple I/O program that asks the user to guess a series of five questions about me, the author!

Running the program will open a new console window, which it will use to begin asking the user questions, and reading user input. 
	Once all questions have been asked, the user will be presented with their score and a simple feedback message.

All interaction takes place through the console; there is no other graphical interface for this program.
